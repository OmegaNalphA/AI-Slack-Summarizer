# AI-Slack-Summarizer
A proof-of-concept to leverage GPT-4 and Slack to summarize the key points in a week long discussion and discuss them.

This was written in Elixir, using Elixir Livebooks. To get it working, check out the documentation [at the livebook github](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook) or install Elixir on your machine and run it using IEX. 

You will need:
1. A Slack Auth Token, preferrably from a Bot
2. A Slack Channel ID
3. An OpenAI API Key

The setup for this is moderately difficult to test and expects a fair amount of knowledge. If you'd like personal help getting this set up for you, I would be more than happy to chat with you over on twitter, [twitter.com/WorldofAnshul](https://twitter.com/WorldofAnshul). Have fun!
